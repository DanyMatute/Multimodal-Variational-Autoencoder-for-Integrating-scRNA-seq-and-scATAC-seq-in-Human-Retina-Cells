# Multimodal-Variational-Autoencoder-for-Integrating-scRNA-seq-and-scATAC-seq-in-Human-Retina-Cells
## About
I’m analyzing **single cells** from the human retina, 

  &rarr; combining their **gene expression** (scRNA-seq) and **chromatin accessibility** (ATAC-seq) data, 

  &rarr; and using a **deep learning model** (a VAE) 

to learn <mark> how gene activity and regulation define distinct cell types. </mark>

This helps us understand both what a cell is doing and how it’s regulated — which is crucial in understanding complex diseases like vision loss. 

## Plan
1. Data acquisition & cleaning (Script/notebook for preprocessing)
2. VAE model implementation (Modular VAE model code)
3. Model training & tuning (Training logs, loss curves)
4. Visualization & analysis (Plots of embeddings, clustering)
5. Biological interpretation (Notebook explaining results)
