# Multimodal-Variational-Autoencoder-for-Integrating-scRNA-seq-and-scATAC-seq-in-Human-Retina-Cells
I’m analyzing **single cells** from the human retina, 

  &rarr; combining their **gene expression** (scRNA-seq) and **chromatin accessibility** (ATAC-seq) data, 

  &rarr; and using a **deep learning model** (a VAE) 

to learn <mark> how gene activity and regulation define distinct cell types. </mark>

This helps us understand both what a cell is doing and how it’s regulated — which is crucial in understanding complex diseases like vision loss.
